# Technology Stack Definition for Project Aether

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the official technology stack for the implementation of Project Aether. The selection of these technologies is guided by the core principles outlined in the `README.md` and the requirements specified in the `Aether_SRS.md`, particularly the need for performance, static safety, scalability, and adherence to modern cloud-native practices.

## 2. Core Implementation Language

**Selection:** **Go (Golang)**

**Justification:**
The `README.md` mandates a primary implementation language that is "statically-typed and promotes memory safety, such as Rust or Go." While both are excellent choices, Go has been selected for the following reasons:

- **Simplicity and Readability:** Go's syntax is intentionally simple and clean, which aligns with the "Verifiable Excellence" principle by promoting the creation of clear and maintainable code.
- **Concurrency:** Go's built-in support for concurrency via goroutines and channels is a natural fit for Aether's multi-agent architecture. It allows for the efficient and straightforward implementation of concurrent sub-agents (ArchitectAgent, CoderAgent, etc.) that can communicate and operate in parallel.
- **Performance:** As a compiled, statically-typed language, Go offers excellent performance, which is critical for a system that will be performing computationally intensive tasks like code analysis, generation, and environment management.
- **Ecosystem:** Go has a robust standard library and a mature ecosystem of tools and libraries for building cloud-native applications, including excellent support for gRPC, containerization, and web services.
- **Safety:** While not as strict as Rust's borrow checker, Go's type safety, memory management (garbage collection), and prohibition of pointer arithmetic eliminate many common bugs and security vulnerabilities found in languages like C++.

## 3. Inter-Agent Communication Protocol

**Selection:** **gRPC with Protocol Buffers**

**Justification:**
Aether is designed as a modular system of collaborative sub-agents. The communication between these agents must be efficient, reliable, and well-defined.

- **Performance:** gRPC is a high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport, enabling features like multiplexing and streaming, which are far more efficient than traditional REST+JSON communication.
- **Strictly-Typed Contracts:** Services and messages are defined in `.proto` files using Protocol Buffers. This creates a strongly-typed, language-agnostic API contract that enforces consistency between the sub-agents. This aligns with the requirement for clearly defined API contracts.
- **Code Generation:** gRPC automatically generates client and server stubs in various languages (including Go), simplifying development and ensuring that the implementation adheres to the defined contract.
- **Streaming:** gRPC supports bidirectional streaming, which will be invaluable for long-running tasks, such as streaming logs from a running process, providing real-time feedback during code generation, or interactive debugging sessions between agents.

## 4. Persistent Memory and Knowledge Base

**Selection:** **PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension**

**Justification:**
The "Persistent Memory and Contextual Learning Framework" requires a vectorized knowledge base for semantic search (RAG).

- **Integrated Solution:** Using PostgreSQL with `pgvector` avoids the need for a separate, dedicated vector database. It allows us to store both structured metadata (e.g., file paths, commit hashes, test results) and unstructured vector embeddings in a single, robust, and well-understood database system.
- **Powerful Querying:** This approach enables powerful hybrid queries that can filter on structured metadata *before* performing a vector similarity search, leading to more efficient and contextually relevant retrievals.
- **Maturity and Reliability:** PostgreSQL is a world-class, battle-tested open-source relational database known for its reliability, feature set, and strong community support.
- **Scalability:** PostgreSQL offers proven scalability options suitable for the large codebases Aether is expected to manage.

## 5. Environment and Deployment

### 5.1 Containerization

**Selection:** **Docker**

**Justification:**
As mandated by the `README.md`, all development and execution must occur in a sandboxed environment. Docker is the industry standard for containerization.

- **Isolation:** Docker containers provide a lightweight, isolated environment, ensuring that Aether's operations and the software it builds do not interfere with the host system or each other.
- **Reproducibility:** Dockerfiles allow for the programmatic definition of environments, ensuring that the development, testing, and deployment environments are identical and reproducible.

### 5.2 Orchestration

**Selection:** **Kubernetes (K8s)**

**Justification:**
The `README.md` specifies Kubernetes for managing Aether's containerized services.

- **Scalability and Resilience:** Kubernetes provides the tools for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It can automatically scale Aether's sub-agents based on workload and restart them if they fail, ensuring high availability and resilience.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** K8s simplifies networking between the various sub-agent services.

### 5.3 Infrastructure as Code

**Selection:** **Terraform**

**Justification:**
As required by the `README.md`, all cloud infrastructure must be managed programmatically.

- **Declarative Infrastructure:** Terraform allows infrastructure to be defined as code, ensuring it is version-controlled, reproducible, and can be provisioned automatically.
- **Cloud Agnostic:** It supports all major cloud providers, giving Aether the flexibility to be deployed in various environments.
- **State Management:** Terraform's state management capabilities provide a reliable way to track and manage infrastructure changes over time.
