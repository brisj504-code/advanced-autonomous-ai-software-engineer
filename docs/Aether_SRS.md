# Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for Project Aether

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the complete software requirements for "Aether," a fully autonomous AI software engineering agent. It serves as the primary technical specification and guiding protocol for the design, development, and deployment of the system.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
Aether is a paradigm shift from contemporary AI coding assistants (co-pilots) to a fully autonomous AI software engineer. It is designed to be a self-directed entity that can interpret high-level objectives and manage the entire SDLC without human intervention post-initialization.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The major functions of Aether include:
- Hierarchical project planning and reasoning.
- Persistent memory and contextual learning for large-scale projects.
- A multi-stage self-healing subsystem for autonomous bug prediction, diagnosis, and repair.
- Dynamic acquisition and operation of new tools (CLIs, SDKs, APIs) from documentation.
- Execution of its own development lifecycle (the ADL).
- Adherence to professional engineering standards for code, testing, security, and documentation.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The primary user is a project stakeholder who provides high-level project requirements. Post-initialization, the system is designed to operate with zero user interaction. Secondary users may include human engineers who review, audit, or collaborate with Aether.

### 2.4 Constraints
- All operations must occur within a secure, containerized sandbox environment.
- The system must adhere to the foundational principles of Radical Autonomy, Proactive Self-Correction, and Verifiable Excellence.
- The system must use a disciplined, industry-standard version control workflow.
- All code must be secure by default and adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Aether will have access to state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Aether will have access to a secure, sandboxed environment with internet connectivity to access documentation and external resources.
- Aether will be provided with the necessary credentials for services it needs to interact with (e.g., cloud providers, API keys).

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### 3.1.1 The Planning and Reasoning Engine
- **FR-1.1:** The engine shall deconstruct high-level goals into a granular, multi-level task tree, from architectural epics to specific implementation tasks.
- **FR-1.2:** The engine shall generate and evaluate multiple potential solution paths for non-trivial tasks, analyzing them against project constraints (performance, security, maintainability).
- **FR-1.3:** The engine shall operate in a continuous feedback loop, using execution outcomes (test failures, compiler errors, security alerts) to dynamically adapt the project plan.
- **FR-1.4:** The engine shall perform a comprehensive dependency analysis during initial planning to generate a complete dependency graph and automate environment setup.

#### 3.1.2 Persistent Memory and Contextual Learning Framework
- **FR-2.1:** The system shall parse, chunk, and index all project artifacts (code, docs, logs, requirements) into a vectorized knowledge base for long-term semantic search.
- **FR-2.2:** All LLM queries must be augmented with relevant context retrieved from the vectorized knowledge base (RAG).
- **FR-2.3:** The system shall log the outcomes of all significant actions and analyze these logs to identify and codify successful patterns and anti-patterns for continuous improvement.

#### 3.1.3 The Self-Healing Subsystem (APR)
- **FR-3.1 (Prediction):** The subsystem shall proactively scan all code for security vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10) and use predictive models to identify defect-prone patterns before testing.
- **FR-3.2 (Interception):** The subsystem shall integrate a runtime monitoring framework to intercept all unhandled exceptions and capture the full execution context (stack trace, variable state, logs).
- **FR-3.3 (Analysis):** The subsystem shall perform automated root cause analysis on captured errors by forming and testing hypotheses based on the contextual data.
- **FR-3.4 (Repair):** The subsystem shall use LLM-based APR techniques to generate potential code fixes. Each patch must be validated in a sandbox against the relevant test suite to ensure it resolves the failure without introducing regressions.

#### 3.1.4 Dynamic Tool Acquisition and Environment Interaction Protocol
- **FR-4.1:** All development operations shall occur within a fully containerized, isolated sandbox environment (e.g., Docker).
- **FR-4.2:** The system shall be able to parse technical documentation (e.g., from a URL) to learn the commands, arguments, and usage patterns of new tools autonomously.
- **FR-4.3:** The system shall use an integrated secrets vault to securely manage API keys, passwords, and other credentials, never exposing them in logs or source code.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-1 (Radical Autonomy):** Human Intervention Rate (HIR) must be less than 0.01 per 1000 lines of code generated.
- **NFR-2 (Proactive Self-Correction):** The agent must autonomously detect, diagnose, and repair >95% of all non-critical bugs and 100% of all runtime errors it introduces. Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) for self-induced bugs must be less than 5 minutes.
- **NFR-3 (Verifiable Excellence):** All generated code must pass automated linting, achieve >90% unit test coverage, and have zero known high-severity vulnerabilities. The composite Code Quality Score must remain above 95/100.
- **NFR-4 (Security):** The system must achieve 100% compliance with automated security checks against the latest OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- **NFR-5 (Performance):** The system's performance, such as lines of code generated per minute and bug-fix time, will be benchmarked and optimized. (Specific metrics to be defined).
- **NFR-6 (Reliability):** The system's core processes will be measured by Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). (Specific metrics to be defined).
- **NFR-7 (Scalability):** The system must be able to operate effectively on codebases exceeding 100,000 lines of code across multiple repositories.

### 3.3 Interface Requirements
- Aether will interact with external systems via standard command-line interfaces, REST APIs, and SDKs.
- It will manage its own development environment, including IDEs, terminals, and browsers, within its sandboxed environment.

## 4. The Aether Development Lifecycle (ADL)
Aether must apply the SDLC to its own creation, following these phases and producing the specified deliverables.

- **4.1 Phase I: Meta-Requirements:** Deliver a version-controlled SRS (this document) and a Methodology Justification Report.
- **4.2 Phase II: Self-Architecture:** Deliver C4 model architecture diagrams, API contracts for all sub-agents, and a Technology Stack Definition document.
- **4.3 Phase III: Implementation:** Deliver source code for all modules in a version-controlled Git repository with full, conventional commit history.
- **4.4 Phase IV: Quality Assurance:** Deliver a comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, E2E) and test coverage reports.
- **4.5 Phase V: Deployment:** Deliver Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts, container definitions, and orchestration manifests for deploying Aether.
- **4.6 Phase VI: Maintenance:** Deliver auto-generated "living" documentation and a self-update/dependency management protocol.

- All new features must have corresponding, passing automated tests with >90% coverage.
- The full test suite must pass in a CI pipeline before any code is merged.

### 5.3 Security and Reliability
- Implement secure coding practices to defend against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
